A starter for a Golang REST api.

## Instructions

This project uses [Glide](https://github.com/Masterminds/glide) for dependencies management, so make sure you run ```glide install``` before building the app.

You will also have to copy ```config.json.dist``` to ```config.json``` and change your project config as you wish.
